go in to .gitignore file add the files names that you want ignore
what if you are working in a project that has so much num of files. sometimes It's not possible to track of everything & add in ignore file right for this there's a solution in oneline
search gitignore generator open and search for ex node that will you common ignore files cmd just copy and paste.

git branch -- It'll give the branches that are present
git branch some_branch_name - It'll create a branch with specific name

git checkout branchName -- to open the branch
git switch branchName   -- to open or switch to that branch

git switch -c branchName   --- to create & switch that branch
git checkout -b branchName --- to create & open the new branch

git merge branchName --- to merge the sub branches code to main branch. "master"
git diff  --- It's used to differntiate b/w the same file with different timelines in staging.

It will open vim terminal. .wq or q to exit from that terminal.

// we can also check the commits between two by adding hashkey & In branches also
git diff hashkey hashkey || git diff hashkey..hashkey
git diff branchName..branchName

git stash  --- It's used stash our changes into one file or folder & use it whenever needed
git stash pop  --- to retrieve the old changes that we made in the stash
git stash list --- to list the stashed ones
git stash apply stashName || stash{0} --- to retrieve which stash changes or stash file that required among all.

git log --oneline

git checkout Head~2  -- to move the head 2 commits back

git commit -am "commit msg" -- It's a shortcut way of adding & commiting at same time

git rebase master --- you need to do in sub branches & don't do on the main or master branch
It's actually unnecessary commit like merge b/w sub branch & main or master branch. we can show all the commits in one line. "graph"
when you got conflicts in rebase time. realx read the hints & do resolve carefully.

generate ssh key & add it in. github, vscode as well

git branch -M main --- It's used the change the branch name of master to main.
